# vt_upload
A python tool to scan files at virustotal.com.
Ð¡onnection is made using the key received during registration on the VT.  

Installing dependencies:
```
pip install vt-py colorama
```

### Principle of operation:
---

* creates a copy of the file from the source directory;
* puts the created copy into a temporary directory ("-buf" key);
* changes the file name to anonymized (like "test.exe");
* sends a hash of the file to check for previous results;
* if the previous result is absent or older than the specified number of days ("-d" key) uploads the file;
* displays the received information and writes it to the log.
